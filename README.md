# Marketing Skills for AI Agents

A curated collection of agent skills and tool integrations for marketing work. Built by the [erron.ai](https://erron.ai) team for technical marketers, founders, and growth engineers who want AI coding agents to handle conversion optimization, copywriting, SEO, analytics, and growth engineering. Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and step-by-step workflows for specific domains. Drop them into your project and your agent will recognize marketing tasks, apply the right frameworks, and produce higher-quality outputs without needing extra prompting.

## How Skills Work Together

Every skill reads from a shared context document before doing anything. This `product-marketing-context` file holds your product description, target audience, and positioning — so you never repeat yourself across tasks.
